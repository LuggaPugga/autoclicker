# AutoClicker

## About

I created this autoclicker because I couldn't find any open-source autoclickers that had all the features I wanted. This project is designed to be simple, powerful, and cross-platform, with a modern UI and essential features. I chose to build it with Electron since it's the tech stack I'm most familiar with. While Electron might not be the most performant choice for an autoclicker, it's what I know best.

## Features

- **Hotkeys:** Easily start and stop clicking with customizable keyboard shortcuts.
- **CPS (Clicks Per Second):** Set and monitor your desired click speed.

## Tech Stack

- **Electron** – Cross-platform desktop app framework
- **RobotJS** – Node.js library for desktop automation (keyboard, mouse control)
- **Shadcn** – UI components
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework

## Compatibility

- **Windows**
- **Linux**
- **Mac** (untested)
